I want to build a dashboard using google sheets apps script.
I have created a google spreadsheet named “DASHBOARD” and my apps script is tied to this spreadsheet.
Inside the “DASHBOARD” spreadsheet I have a google sheet named “dataset” with the following columns;
o   “Date” (“Column A”) | Date format is “DD-MM-YYYY” so please manage accordingly when you fetch data on front-end to create dashboard.
o   “Entity Name” (“Column B”)

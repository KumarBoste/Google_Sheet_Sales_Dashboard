# Google Sheet Sales Dashboard Report
Using Google Sheet Apps Script & AI

 ## Project Overview
The Google Sheets Sales Dashboard is an interactive business intelligence solution developed using Google Apps Script, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The dashboard transforms raw sales data stored in Google Sheets into real-time, visually rich insights that help stakeholders monitor sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and regional trends.

This project demonstrates how Google Sheets can be extended beyond spreadsheets into a lightweight BI tool, similar to Power BI or Tableau, without external software dependencies.
